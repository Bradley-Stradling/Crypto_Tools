# Crypto_Tools

A repo to house some tools I'm working on for making crypto functions make sense, as well as practice bash 5.0

"Basic_Rotation_Cipher.sh" is being called complete. It does not handle special char's but due to the rotational varriable being constant this isnt a problem.

"Keyword_Rotational_Cipher.sh" is in working order. Special char's will likely break the scripts rotational count through the keyword values, but spaces won't.
Currently any newlines will also throw off the count and break the script.
