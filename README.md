# Crypto_Tools

A repo to house some tools I'm working on for making crypto functions make sense, as well as practice bash 5.0

"Basic_Rotation_Cipher.sh" is being called complete. It does not handle spaces or special char's, but it is functional in the basic principal of a rotational chipher.
Should likely make use of the fold command to format the output to 80 char's per line for easier reading, rather than writing everything to one liine.
