# Crypto_Tools

A repo to house some tools I'm working on for making crypto functions make sense, as well as practice bash 5.0

"Basic_Rotation_Cipher.sh" is being called complete. It does not handle spaces or special char's, but it is functional in the basic principal of a rotational chipher.

"Keyword_Rotational_Cipher.sh" is not complete, only the help function has been changed after duplicating the basic rotational cipher.
